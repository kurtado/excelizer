In just a few minutes, you can email the output of Perl DBI SQL commands in Excel CSV format. Just fill in your favorite SQL query ($sql), email recipients, and SQL credentials, and you're done!

Your favorite MBA will love these cron-fired spreadsheets sent directly to their inbox... You'll probably need to dial in various elements of the script for your environment... SQL credentials, MIME-types, email delivery mechanism, etc. etc. etc. Pull requests encouraged... YMMV.
